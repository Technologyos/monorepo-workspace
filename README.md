### Steps to setting up the database

1. **Create the container:** To create the container, run the following command in the terminal: `docker-compose up -d`. Once the creation is complete, go to the following pgAdmin URL in your browser: [http://localhost:8080/login?next=/](http://localhost:8080/login?next=/).

2. **Enter credentials from the .env file:** Before proceeding, you need to enter your credentials from the `.env` file to access pgAdmin. Look for the `PGA_EMAIL` and `PGA_PASSWORD` variables and enter them during login.

3. **Create the server in pgAdmin:**  In the pgAdmin interface, go to the "Servers" section. Right-click to open a menu, then select "Register" and "Server."

4. **Server configuration:** In the server configuration window, fill in the following details:

   #### General
   - **name:** postgres (name of the PostgreSQL container)

   #### Connection
   - **Host name/address:** postgres (name of the PostgreSQL container)
   - **Post:** 5432
   - **Maintenance database:** space_db
   - **username:** technologyos
   - **password:** YXNhbGF6YXJqQGdtYWlsLmNvbToqR

After completing the details, click "Save" to establish the connection.

**Note:** Remember that these details are stored in the `.env`, file, where your credentials were previously configured.
